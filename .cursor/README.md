# Operator harness

Map of the Cursor command cycle in this folder. Command files under
[`commands/`](commands/) are the source of truth.

Work ships on the **`staging` accumulator** (feature PR = `<head> → staging`,
then promotion = `staging →` default branch). Agents never merge. You merge
in the GitHub UI. Linear **In Progress** / **In Review** / **Done** are
automation-owned (draft/open PR, review/ready-for-merge, closing-linked merge).

Linear IDs are **`RES-###`** on the fixed **Realized** team. Linear projects
are discovered dynamically: active work routes only to live nonterminal
**`V-X.X`** projects, classified ongoing/available from their Linear status
and allocated fail-closed by
[`rules/linear-project-routing.mdc`](rules/linear-project-routing.mdc).
Specs live in [`docs/specs/`](../docs/specs/).
Linear Triage is the special intake inbox. Ordinary accepted work lands in
Backlog without a cycle; `/dispatch` schedules only its confirmed bounded
selection into Todo/current cycle.

Milestones are project-owned M1–M9 routes: `/design` is M1–M3
pre-implementation work; `/sdd-to-tdd` routes contract clarification to M2,
implementation to M4, and test/beta/UAT/launch/maintenance work to M5–M9.
Tracked routing/spec conflicts use one bounded `Clarification required`
comment through `linear-resolver`; the existing Linear-to-Slack relay provides
visibility. That comment never triggers In Review/Done automation.

Vercel team **ralfcams-projects** (`team_MP13K4M0To2S4Duu2kknllAb`), git-linked
project **restaurant-system** (`prj_wFVDqQOtf6cjuUXscIoHDbtHzTTz`). Dashboard:
[ralfcams-projects/restaurant-system](https://vercel.com/ralfcams-projects/restaurant-system).
MCP namespace `plugin-vercel-vercel` (`get_project` / `list_deployments` on
this `prj_`). Env vars and `vercel link` are **CLI-only** — this MCP has no
env tools. Runbook:
[`docs/runbooks/deploy.md`](../docs/runbooks/deploy.md). Rule:
[`rules/vercel-project.mdc`](rules/vercel-project.mdc).

**Plan Mode only:** [`/audit`](commands/audit.md), [`/triage`](commands/triage.md),
[`/dispatch`](commands/dispatch.md), [`/sdd-to-tdd`](commands/sdd-to-tdd.md),
[`/design`](commands/design.md).
[`/intake`](commands/intake.md) has no Plan Mode gate.

There is no GitHub QA workflow in this repo. Local gates are
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test:unit`.

## Recommended cycle

`docs/findings + Linear Triage` → `/triage` → `Backlog` → `/dispatch` →
`Todo/current cycle` → (`/sdd-to-tdd` → `/commit` → `/push`)×N → you merge

`/audit` remains spec-first and writes findings to the ledger, then publishes
one idempotent project-health digest through `linear-resolver`. Linear is
visibility only, never the audit acceptance bar.

- **Greenfield (no owning spec):** idea → [`/design`](commands/design.md) →
  new `docs/specs/<slug>.md` → `/sdd-to-tdd @<file>` FEATURE
- **Cloud Agent PR:** [`/intake`](commands/intake.md) for
  `cursor/<slug>-<4 hex>` heads. Run `/intake` **before** `/push` on the
  local lane when such a PR is open.
