 * beforeMCPExecution: deny parent Linear save_issue / save_comment unless

 *
 * subagentStart (matcher linear-resolver): set the allow flag.
 *   node .cursor/hooks/linear-write-guard.mjs start
 * subagentStop (matcher linear-resolver): clear the allow flag.
 *   node .cursor/hooks/linear-write-guard.mjs stop
 *
 * list_* / get_* reads stay unrestricted (triage PHASE 0). docs-updater
 * and feedback-validator must not set this flag (hooks.json matcher is
 * linear-resolver only).
 *
 * Fails OPEN (failClosed: false in hooks.json): a crashing failClosed hook
 * on this matcher would brick every MCP call. Payload shapes and the
 * liveness standard: .cursor/rules/hook-authoring.mdc.
 *
 * New beforeMCPExecution entries do not hot-reload mid-session — live
 * denial needs a Cursor window reload. Spawn-level tests are the logic
 * proof until then.
