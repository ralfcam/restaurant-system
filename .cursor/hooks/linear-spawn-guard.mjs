/**
 * beforeMCPExecution: always-on interlock against Linear Cloud Agent spawn.
 *
 * Denies Linear MCP calls that open any of the three spawn doors
 * (save_issue.assignee including null, save_issue.delegate, or an @Cursor
 * mention in a comment / title / description / patch op). See
 * .cursor/hooks/lib/linear-spawn-policy.mjs and
 * .cursor/rules/linear-automation.mdc.
 *
 * Always-on — not gated on isArmed(). Fail-open (failClosed: false in
 * hooks.json) is deliberate: a crashing failClosed hook on this matcher
 * would brick every MCP call and take /triage, /capture, and
 * linear-resolver down with it. git-stage-guard remains the only
 * failClosed Shell hook.
 *
 * Local-only: Cursor's MCP hook events are unavailable in cloud agents,
 * so a cloud agent with Linear MCP access is still restrained by prose.
 *
 * Registered on beforeMCPExecution (not preToolUse CallMcpTool): Cursor
 * delivers MCP calls as tool_name=<mcp tool>, tool_input as a JSON string,
 * mcp_server_name/command as the server key. A CallMcpTool matcher never
 * fires. Payload shapes and the liveness standard:
 * .cursor/rules/hook-authoring.mdc.
